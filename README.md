 ## About the website
### Project planning
This is my first time coding javascript so first I needed to look at different quizes both of how to code and what I wanted in my quiz. I looked at youtube and looked through some code I could find on the internet that matches what I wanted. I also brought with me knowledge from my diploma course in coding. I wanted a quiz that had questions in different categories and easy for the user to maneuver through.  
I have used Balsamiq to plan how the quiz should look like. I did it very easy layout because I did`nt know when I started how easy or hard my decisions would be to code in javascript.
Here is my rough plan: [About Sweden Quiz](https://github.com/jlindeloef/about-sweden-quiz/blob/main/readme-images/About%20Sweden.pdf)

As you might see my quiz is a bit different than my balsamiq sheet. It's because I did not know when I started coding that it would feel natural to have an "End Game"-button and a "Reset"-button at the end of the quiz.

### UX
